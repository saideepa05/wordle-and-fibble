# wordle-and-fibble

This project explores reinforcement learning (RL) applied to Wordle and Fibble, 5 letter word-guessing game. The agent learns optimal guessing strategies using deep reinforcement learning techniques.
The RL agent is trained using Q-learning and various action representations to maximize the win rate. The project compares the performance of different training configurations and learning strategies.

### Wordle is a popular word-guessing game where players try to guess a five-letter word within six attempts. After each guess, the game provides feedback on the guessed letters:
ðŸŸ© Green â†’ The letter is correct and in the right position.
ðŸŸ¨ Yellow â†’ The letter is correct but in the wrong position.
â¬œ Gray â†’ The letter is not in the word.

### What is Fibble?
Fibble is a variant of Wordle where one or more hints (letter colors) may be lies:
Fibble1 â†’ Wordle with 1 lie per game.
Fibble2 â†’ Wordle with 2 lies per game.
Fibble3 â†’ Wordle with 3 lies per game.
Fibble4 â†’ Wordle with 4 lies per game.
Fibble5 â†’ Wordle with 5 lies per game.
The more lies included, the harder it is for the RL agent to infer the correct word.

### Features
